## General info
The purpose of writing this demo was to learn how to use Scala.js to write front-end web applications for the web 
with Scala code. Since this has been done during the time of Covid-19 the application is a simple simulation of a 
pandemic outbreak with bouncing circles that spreads an infection and get immunity after some time. The starting 
conditions can easily be changed using sliders. 

#### Features
* 2D Physics library for moving and bouncing circles
* HTML document building with Scala.js
* HTML Canvas manipulation with scala.js
* Unit testing

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) 2.13.1 
* [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org) 1.0.1 
* [utest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest) 0.7.4
* [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/)

## Setup
#### Install
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

#### node.js packages
##### jsdom 

is needed for DOM support for node.js
```
$ npm install jsdom
```
##### source-map-support
For resolving stack traces (debugging js)
```
$ npm install source-map-support
```
	
## Run
#### Developer mode
```
$ sbt fastOptJS
```
open index-dev.html in browser

#### Release mode
This will generate a much smaller JavaScript file that is more difficult to debug.
```
$ sbt fullOptJS
```
open index.html in browser

## Test
```
$ sbt test
```
